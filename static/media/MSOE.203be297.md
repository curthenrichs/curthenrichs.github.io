# MSOE
During my time at MSOE I achieved the following degree:

Bachelor of Science
- Major: Computer Engineering
- Minor: Mathematics

Coming into undergrad, I had some exposure to engineering via FIRST robotics and high school level courses. My emphasis during this degree was to develop my embedded system engineering acumen. Developing systems requires a "triple-helix" of hardware, software, and user experience expertise. MSOE provided a base track for computer engineering with elective options in field (EE, CE, SW, or CS), which already worked two portions of the "triple-helix". Additionally, I needed to fulfill general humanities requirements and electives, which started rounding out the design / user experience portion.
