Authr was designed to enable engineers to develop collaborative tasks with better allocations for the agents involved. Users could take their existing work descriptions and convert it to a human robot collaborative process where the agent allocation was optimized by Authr. The interface consisted of three workflow phases: (1) Environment Setup, (2) Plan Description, (3) Simulation. We evaluated the user interface with a couple of user studies.
 
My contributions tended toward backend ROS integration, robot simulation, and the data server.
