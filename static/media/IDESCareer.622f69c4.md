# IDES

IDES (a JEOL subsidiary) is a small company with 10+ employees working in the transmission electron microscope (TEM) market. IDES sells a deflector sub-framing system called Relativity, an electrostatic dose modulation system (EDM), and related TEM peripherals to support scientific applications. 

## Firmware Engineer

My role as the primary firmware engineer at IDES has me focusing on maintaining and extending existing firmware, developing new voltage control firmware for our flagship product Movie-Mode, and performing various hardware bringups for PCBAs. Our firmware ecosystem is mixed C/C++ on baremetal Xilinx Zynq and Atmel/Microchip processor. I have worked on preparing Nvidia Jetson Xaiver system images with Avermedia for production of the IDES Acuity Edge platform.

Due to the nature of working at a small company, I also have worked on projects outside of my narrowly defined firmware role. I have built out both R&D and production EDM, Relativity, and Luminary electronic components. I assisted in ECAD development tasks and PCBA / component procurement. Additionally, I have worked on user facing software in python that interfaces with our various hardware products. Finally, I performed manufacturing duties for electronic components within our products.

## Senior Embedded Systems Engineer

My promotion to senior embedded system engineer brought modest changes to my responsibilities. I am continuing to support existing hardware/firmware shipped to customers; including working with JEOL Ltd. to diagnose/test our systems in Japan and in the field. I have spent time refactoring our codebase for maintainability and building out test frameworks (where previously there werenâ€™t any - again due to the size of the company). 

A major refactoring example is transitioning our Xilinx codebase from supporting the z7030 SOC to now also supporting z7020 and ultrascale+ variant builds with a common codebase. This was motivated by our z7030 module source drying up due to parts shortages. We initially investigated the z7020 but found it was only acceptable for a subset of our use cases. Therefore, we made the leap to ultrascale+ for one product line and z7020 for another (with the z7020 being significantly cheaper and already having a stockpile). Existing z7030 units must continue to be supported with new features.

On the manufacturing side, I assisted in the hiring process for a manufacturing engineer. I trained them in our electronics manufacturing processes and continue to provide support for units failing QA. Extensive documentation that I maintained while building the units myself were rather helpful in the training process. Separately, I am assisting in standardizing our packing procedures and training our logistics specialist on the latest process. Finally, I rounded out my manufacturing work with continued maintenance on our MRP system; including transitioning to a new nested MO structure.

I have several projects in progress. 

The first two are continuation of Xilinx SOC firmware development for our applications: transitioning to FreeRTOS and utilizing the second core as an onboard application specific accelerator. Currently our firmware uses a single z7030 ARM core with a simple round-robin service scheme. The round-robin approach works well given limited services though as that number increases (i.e., with the acceleration core) I expect it to falter. FreeRTOS is selected due to existing Xilinx support, free to use, and well established. 

I am also working on selecting new Atmel microcontrollers, ETH controllers, and I2C components for upgraded revisions of our existing products. My goal with the I2C components is to design a dual population scheme for each; with different component families/manufacturers. Ideally, this hedges against future supply shortages. For microcontrollers and ETH controllers I am steering toward easy to build / maintain solutions with minimal rework risk (primarily motivated by manpower constraints). 

I am aiming to complete these projects Q1 2023.
