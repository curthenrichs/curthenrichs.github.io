# MSOE
During my time at MSOE I achieved the following degree:

Bachelor of Science
- Major: Computer Engineering
- Minor: Mathematics

My emphasis during this degree was to develop my embedded system engineering accumen. Developing systems requires a "triple-helix" of hardware, software, and user experience expertise. MSOE provided a base track for 
computer engineering with elective options in field (EE, CE, SW, or CS). Additionally, I needed to fufill general humanities requirements and electives. I selected electives to fit to my helix model.

Why helix? A helix is a spiraling structure (think DNA). Each layer of the helix is built on previous skills and linked to the other themes within the helix. Building all three skillsets complement and enhance each other. General advise is to be a "T" shaped developer with deep singular skillset and a broad shallow base knowledge. Perhaps this is good advise for a specialist, I have never wanted to be a specialist. A generalist has better impact when at the system architect level (my goal). My Helix model lets me drill down accross skills creating deep links between domains.

## Courses
Below are the courses taken during this degree. I have broken them up by major theme for purusal.

### Computer Engineering & Electrical Engineering



### Software Engineering & Computer Science



### General Sciences & Mathematics



### Business / Econmics



### Humanities
