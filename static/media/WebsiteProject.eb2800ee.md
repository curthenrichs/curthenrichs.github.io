This website has been a project in its own right. Originally, I had planned on using a no-code / low-code tool to generate my portfolio website. However, I couldnâ€™t quite find a tool with the flexibility / configurability I had in mind for my website. More specifically, I wanted a place to aggregate my projects, skills, publications, social media profiles, etc. into one place that I had complete creative control over. To build this website, I tapped into my experience building robot user interfaces (a skill I picked up in graduate school). 

I am rather pleased with the responsive design solution, given my lack of expertise in the area. My vision was to have a dynamic summary section and skills section dependent on screen width; adjusting between three major layouts: phone, tablet vertical, and landscape.
