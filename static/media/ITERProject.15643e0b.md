# Experiments
In addition to researching robot authoring environments, I investigated how human workers can collaborate
with the cobot. My colleagues and I developed two experiments, pRAD and Task Interdependence,
within a protocol. We used a Universal Robots UR3e for this research. Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/Wisc-HCI/ITER).

## pRAD
The objective of the pRAD experiment is to investigate the predictive robot
attention demand signal for use in cobot operator interfaces. We developed a
timeline based interface and a simple timer interface for comparision with
the pRAD signal. The operator is responsible for two tasks; inspecting a magnetic
block toy house being constructed by the robot and a secondary sorting task.

I was the lead experimenter/author on this project. Our paper is [here]()

## Task Interdependence
The objective of the task interdependence experiment is to investigate three strategies
of interdependence (pooled, sequential, reciprocal) for the workers' performance and social
perception measures. The human and robot shared a single task; to construct a small
magnetic block toy house. Our paper is [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9223555).

My contributions were on the technical development of the experiment procdure
and on running/monitoring the software during evaluation. Through this project
I became familiar with the Universal Robots platform and its visual programming
tool, Polyscope.
