# UW Madison
During my time at UW Madison, I achieved the following degree:

Master of Science
- Major: Computer Science

My goal was to take the engineering acumen developed in undergrad and build on top various skills in robotics, research, additional computer science, and user experience.

I have found my interest is heavily within application over developing theory. I am not interested in being a mathematician, who happens to think about compute problems. I enjoy tackling engineering problems utilizing mathematics, science, and practical knowledge to build a real system that interacts with real users with all of the messy bits that happens when a system is physically situated.

During graduate school I also worked as a research assistant and teaching assistant. Please see my career section - UW Madison for details regarding this as it heavily shaped my experience during this degree.
