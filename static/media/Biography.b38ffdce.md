Hello, I am a firmware engineer at IDES, a company focused on time resolved electron microscopy. 
My work spans from the mundane (board bringup and minor EDA for variant ICs) to the intellectually
stimulating (embedded software engineering) with plenty of QA and small batch manufacturing mixed in. 
Our embedded platforms center around Xilinx Zynq and Microchip ATMEGA.

In graduate school I studied Computer Science with a focus on how humans can effectively
utilize collaborative robots within the manufacturing context. My time as a graduate student and research 
assistant at UW - Madison in the People and Robots Lab balances my Computer Engineering undergraduate 
degree from MSOE.

I am passionate about building real things for real people, whether it be robotics, embedded devices, or software tools.
