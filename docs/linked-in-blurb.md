# About
Hello, I'm Curt, an embedded engineer currently working on peripherals for time-resolved transmission electron microscopy. My work spans firmware development across FPGA/SoC and microcontroller platforms, hardware bringup, PCB design, and software architecture, with manufacturing and QA mixed in. I primarily work within Xilinx and Microchip-Atmel ecosystems. More recently, I've been exploring AI-augmented development workflows to accelerate firmware and software tasks.

I am passionate about building real things for real people, whether it be robots, embedded devices, or software tools. In my free time one can find me tinkering with hobby robotics / home-automation projects or curled up reading a good non-fiction book.

# IDES
## Senior Embedded Systems Engineer
Promoted to senior engineer to lead firmware architecture, hardware design, and mentoring across a small engineering team. Continued supporting shipped systems internationally alongside our parent company.

The value I have added to IDES:

- Transitioned Xilinx codebase to support multiple SoC variants under a unified Vivado/Vitis build process.
- Implemented AXI DMA pipeline achieving 10x memory throughput improvement for a key application.
- Led bare-metal to FreeRTOS migration, enabling dual-core acceleration with embedded REST API and web dashboard.
- Designed a USB user-interface peripheral end-to-end: schematic capture, firmware, mechanical design, driver development, and productization.
- Refactored hardware control backend from tightly coupled architecture to decoupled PubSub-based system with layered testing strategy.
- Led component selection for next-gen products focused on supply-chain resilience.
- Trained manufacturing engineers, authored build documentation, and maintained MRP system.
- Exploring AI-augmented development workflows for firmware and software tasks using agentic coding tools.

## Firmware Engineer
Primary firmware engineer developing voltage control firmware for IDES flagship product on Xilinx Zynq SoC. Maintained and extended mixed C/C++ firmware across Zynq and Atmel/Microchip platforms. Prepared embedded Linux system images for edge computer vision platform production.

Also took on electronics manufacturing, ECAD support, PCBA procurement, and user-facing Python software development. Quickly promoted to senior engineer.

# UW Madison

## Graduate Research Assistant
During this role, I developed extensive documentation and bringup code for Universal Robots UR3e and Microsoft Hololens 1 and 2. I cooperated with several colleagues outside of the lab (in Human Factors and Optimization) to investigate the effectiveness of cobots by analyzing a variety of manual work activities. I contributed to various lab infrastructure/processes and managed the lab's centralized robot description and configuration repository.

My successes:

- Tested and revised Robotiq gripper ROS drivers for colleagues under paper deadline.
- Designed collaborative robot (cobot) authoring and training interfaces (Authr, CoFrame) using web technologies: React / Angular with ROS backend.
- Investigated interactions with cobots for both attention management (pRAD) and task interdependence.
- Used grounded theory analysis on participant interviews to generate design suggestions for future implementations.

## Teaching Assistant
TA'ed for CS 506 - Software Engineering. 

Primarily spent my time grading assignments and group project mentorship.

# Dedicated Computing
## R&D Software Engineering Intern
I served as an R&D Software Engineering intern for several summers. Each internship season was an opportunity to develop foundational skills in embedded systems such as firmware development in C/C++. I prototyped server hardware and software systems, including Matrix Storage, OLED Display, and Fan Controller. I utilized Python to link embedded devices to our server control software.

My successes:

- Produced firmware for several embedded systems including, Matrix Storage, OLED Display, and Fan Controller.
- Devised internal hardware testing infrastructure (Thermal Chamber) using NodeJS, Python, and MongoDB.
- Facilitated product life-cycle documentation for design, implementation, and testing.

# Domino's Pizza
Every work-life has to start somewhere. I was fortunate enough to start at a Domino's pizza in my home town. My role taught me crucial customer interaction skills as well as order processing / food preparation.
