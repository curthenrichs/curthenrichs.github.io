# HCI and Data Visualization
In my graduate coursework I had the opportunity to redesign an HCI redesign project
and to take a data visulization course.

## HCI - Universal Robots Teach Pendant Redesign
I worked with two undergrads to redesign the Universal Robots teach pendant. We
started by investigating the breakdowns in the current system. Then we iterated
on low fidelity and high fidelity prototypes to explore the breakdowns. For
each iteration we performed usability tests with participants and performed
heuristic evaulations.

High fidelity design was in Adobe XD.

## Data Visualization - Final Project
For my data visualization final project, I had to explore Amazon's categorical
data. I created two interactive visualizations.

The first serves as an exploratory overview visualization. The system exposes
the top deepest categories to the user for all main categories. The user can
adjust these parameters to see more / less branches, more / less categories,
and showing other categories. Users can then identify the unique structure of
categories (such as category branches sharing many / few parents).

The second visualization provides a more detailed view of the categorical data.
The assumption is that the selected category is discovered by visualization one.
The traces visualized in cyan are exposed in the summary view and those in red
are aditional traces. Users can hover over nodes to expose their name.
