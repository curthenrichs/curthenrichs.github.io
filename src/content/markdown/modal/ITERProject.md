# Experiments

During graduate school, I investigated how human workers collaborate with the cobot. My colleagues and I developed two experiments, pRAD and Task Interdependence, within an experiment protocol. We used a Universal Robots UR3e cobot for this research. Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/Wisc-HCI/ITER).

## Task Interdependence

The objective of the task interdependence experiment is to investigate three strategies of interdependence (pooled, sequential, reciprocal) for the workers' performance and social perception measures. The human and robot shared a single task; to construct a small magnetic block toy house. Our paper is [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9223555).

My contributions were on the technical development of the experiment procedure and on running/monitoring the software during evaluation. Through this project I became familiar with the Universal Robots platform and its visual programming tool, Polyscope.

## pRAD

The objective of the pRAD experiment is to investigate the predictive robot attention demand signal for use in cobot operator interfaces. We developed a timeline based interface and a simple timer interface for comparison  with the pRAD signal. The operator is responsible for two tasks; inspecting a magnetic block toy house being constructed by the robot and a secondary sorting task.

I was the lead experimenter/author on this project. Our paper is [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9515519). As lead experimenter my contributions were both technical and research based.
