# UW Madison
During my timee at UW Madison, I achived the following degree:

Master of Science
- Major: Computer Science

My goal was to take the engineering accuman developed in undergrad and build ontop with robotics, research, and user experience per my helix model.

I have found my interest is heavily within application. I am not interested in being a mathematician, who happens to think about compute problems. I enjoy tackling engineering problems utilizing mathematics, science, and pratical knowledge to build a real system that interacts with real users with all of the messy bits that happens when a system is physically situated.

During graduate school I also worked as a research assistant and teaching assistant. Please see my career section - UW Madison for details regarding this as it heavily shaped my experience.

## Courses
Below are the courses taken during this degree. I have broken them up by major theme for purusal.

### HCI



### Systems
