*An engineer is someone passionate about building real things for real people.*

Thing is an overloaded term, however, when I use it I mean the artifacts
that we build in order to improve life in some respects. This improvement
could be measured with something objective like revenue or usage time.
Alternatively, it could be a subjective measure such as enjoyment. Likewise,
people can be the end user but it could also be
another engineer interacting with the code base. Regardless, what is important
to me is that I am, in some capacity, adding value when I develop a system.


I am interested and have experience in three areas of work:
- Robotics
- Embedded Systems
- Software

Please review my resumes below. Each has been tailored for its respective area
of interest.
