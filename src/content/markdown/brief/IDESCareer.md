IDES is a JEOL group subsidiary working in the transmission electron microscope (TEM) market. IDES develops Relativity sub-framing system, electrostatic dose modulation system, and various other TEM peripheral systems to support scientific applications.

As the primary embedded systems engineer, I focus on extending existing firmware, developing new voltage control firmware, and performing hardware bringups. Our firmware ecosystem is mixed C/C++ across Xilinx Zynq SoC and Atmel/Microchip platforms.
