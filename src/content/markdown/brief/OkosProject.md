Okos Polip is a device-to-cloud state ingester platform as a service, acting as the middleman between various hardware devices (e.g., my various DIY projects) and external integrations (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Home). The motivation for this work was a realization that home automation state ingest is often reimplemented due to hard coupling to various firmware/hardware constraints or external integrations. My goal is to provide a _descriptive_ general purpose ingest service regardless of whether the physical device implementation is a ROS-based robot running on linux or a baremetal ESP8266.

There is still significant work to be done; stay tuned.
