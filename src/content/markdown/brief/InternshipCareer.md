I interned with Dedicated Computing for three summers. Through this opportunity I was able to work on several projects with the R&D team. On this team I experienced agile development and frequent code reviews. I worked on several notable projects that shaped my engineering acumen: OLED node display, backplane system monitor, thermal chamber test automation, etc.
 
My embedded system work was targeted for Atmel microcontrollers with embedded C. I often interfaced with the embedded systems using drivers written in Python.
