I interned with Dedicated Computing for three summers on the R&D team, gaining experience in agile development and frequent code reviews. I worked on several embedded firmware projects including a storage backplane monitor, OLED node display, fan controller, and thermal chamber test automation.

My embedded work targeted Atmel microcontrollers with embedded C. I often interfaced with the embedded systems using drivers written in Python.
