I interned with Dedicated Computing for three summers. Through this opportunity I was able to work on several projects with the R&D team. On this team I gained experienced in agile development and frequent code reviews. During this internship, I worked on several notable projects that shaped my engineering acumen, e.g., OLED node display, backplane system monitor, and thermal chamber test automation.
 
My embedded system work was targeted for Atmel microcontrollers with embedded C. I often interfaced with the embedded systems using drivers written in python.
