Hello, I'm Curt, an embedded systems engineer currently working on peripherals for time-resolved transmission electron microscopy. My work spans from the mundane (board bringup, minor EDA in response to the parts shortage, and firmware maintenance) to the intellectually stimulating (FPGA / SoC firmware development) with plenty of small batch manufacturing and QA mixed in. My firmware work tends to be within Xilinx and Microchip-Atmel ecosystems though I have dabbled with others.

In graduate school I studied *Computer Science* with a focus on how humans can effectively utilize collaborative robots within the manufacturing context. My time as a grad student and research assistant at UW - Madison balances my *Computer Engineering* undergraduate degree from MSOE. With both a rigorous engineering background and a human-centered research perspective I can bring unique insights into the embedded system development process.

I am passionate about building real things for real people, whether it be robots, embedded devices, or software tools. In my free time one can find me tinkering with hobby robotics / home-automation projects or curled up reading a good non-fiction book.
